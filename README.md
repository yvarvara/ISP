# Pixel-Art

#### Task

the clustering task can be described as follows: the task of grouping a set of objects into subsets (clusters) in such a way that objects from one cluster are more similar to each other than to objects from other clusters by some criterion.

In this project, I would like to conduct a study of several methods for solving this problem, adding a game component to the project.

#### Used technologies

+ The application is implemented using Python programming language
+ MongoDB is used to work with the database
+ Tkinter library is used to create the graphical interface

## Project description

the game allows you to create images by painting pixels on the canvas with a certain color. With a help of clusterization we get an image divided into many blocks that the user can color. The app supports saving created images and the ability to continue drawing after restarting the program.
One of the main goals of this application is also to demonstrate the operation of the clustering methods considered, which are used to split an image into the required number of colors.

## Usage
